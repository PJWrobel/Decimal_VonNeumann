#Decimal_VonNeumann
Graphical learning tool using a decimal version of the Von Neumann architecture

This tool is used in conjunction with the video series "Computer Science Made Easy" https://www.youtube.com/playlist?=a534gTa (not the current name).

The goal is to introduce anyone with a highschool math background to computer science in a way which teaches architecture in a format that
abstracts away from the many pitfalls of the "architecture first" teaching method, include electronics and binary arithmetic. I have tried to
introduce these concepts early on, however it leads to students needing to keep track of too many things at one time resulting in losing the big
picture which I believe is the most crucial part to understanding computers. My two focuses in the first part of the course which this software
covers, is forming an understanding of memory, pointers, and a twist on decimal arithmetic in a way which engages the students to come up with
their own solutions to problems as they arise.
